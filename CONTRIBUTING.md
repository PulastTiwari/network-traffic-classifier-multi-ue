## Development Workflow

### 1. Code Standards

#### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes

Example:

```python
def classify_traffic(data: pd.DataFrame, model: RandomForestClassifier) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Classify network traffic data using the trained model.

    Args:
        data: Preprocessed traffic data
        model: Trained classification model

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing predictions and confidence scores
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### JavaScript/Frontend

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

### 2. Testing

#### Run Existing Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

#### Write New Tests

- Add unit tests for new functions
- Include integration tests for major features
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test:

```python
def test_traffic_classification():
    """Test basic traffic classification functionality."""
    from src.model_trainer import ModelTrainer

    trainer = ModelTrainer()
    # Test implementation
    assert trainer is not None
```

### 3. Documentation

#### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Include type hints
- Explain complex algorithms

#### User Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add examples for new functionality
- Update API documentation

### 4. Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `test:` adding tests
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `style:` formatting changes

Examples:

```bash
feat: add support for LSTM traffic classification
fix: resolve port conflict in Flask application
docs: update installation instructions for Windows
test: add unit tests for synthetic data generator
```
